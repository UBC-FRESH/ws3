"""
This module implements functions for formulating and solving optimization problems.
The notation is very generic (i.e., refers to variables, constraints, problems, solutions, etc.).
All the wood-supply-problem--specific references are implemented in the ``forest`` module.

The ``Problem`` class is the main functional unit here. It encapsulates optimization problem data (i.e., variables, constraints, objective function, and optimal solution), as well as methods to operate on this data (i.e., methods to build and solve the problem, and report on the optimal solution).

Note that we implemented a modular design that decouples the implementation from the choice of solver. Currently, only bindings to the Gurobi solver are implemented, although bindings to other solvers can easilty be added (we will add more binding in later releases, as the need arises).
