Introduction
============

*Wood Supply Simulation System* (``ws3``) is an open-source Python software package 
that is designed to model *wood supply planning problems* (WSPP), in the context of  
sustainable forest management.

A WSPP consists of determining the location, nature, and timing of forest management 
activities (i.e., *actions*) for a given forest, typically over multiple planning 
periods or rotations. The planning horizon often spans over 100 years or more. 
WSPP are intently complicated problems. In practice WSPP are supported by complex 
software models that that simulate different sequences of *actions* and *growth* for 
each time step, starting from and initial forest inventory. These software models are 
typically classified as wood supply models.

All wood supply models (WSM) require complex input data sets, which can be divided 
into *static* and *dynamic* components. Static WSM input data types include initial 
forest inventory, growth and yield curves, action definitions, transition definitions, 
and a schedule of prescribed activities. Dynamic WSM input data may include a 
combination of heuristic and optimization-based processes to automatically derive a 
dynamic activity schedule. The dynamic inputs get layered on top of the static activity 
schedule.

Given a set of static inputs, a given WSM can be used to simulate a number of 
*scenarios*. Generally, scenarios differ only in terms of the dynamic activity 
schedule that is simulated. Comparing output from several scenarios is the basic 
mechanism by which forest managers derive insight from wood supply models.

``ws3`` is backed by a well documented application programming interface (API), which 
can be customized to control the way ``ws3`` behaves. 

About this User Guide
=====================

This guide is divided into four main sections. The first section describes general 
concepts about WSM with specific linkages to the ``ws3`` requirements. This section 
covers ideas and requirements that are consistent across most WSM and is designed to 
ensure proper language use and highlight commonalities. Users who are familiar with 
WSM will likely find this section a review but, it will help ensure clarity for 
successive sections in this guide. 

The second section provides specific and detailed information about ``ws3`` and provides 
guidance on data preparation and running a wood supply simulation. 

The third section provides information for connecting ``ws3`` to libCMB, allowing for 
carbon accounting to be included as a dynamic value within the WSM. 

The fourth section provides information on connecting ``ws3`` to SpaDES. SpaDES is a **SPA**\ 
tially explicit **D**\ iscrete **E**\ vent **S**\ imulation used for disturbance modelling.  

About FRESH
===========

The Forest Resources Environmental Services Hub (FRESH) is a research group at the University 
of British Columbia (UBC), Canada, that focuses on sustainable forest management including 
wood supply analysis, optimization research and supply chain analysis. 

One of the primary focuses of the research group is to develop open sourced information and 
software packages that increase the accessibility of higher level forest modelling including 
tools used in WSPP and WSM. The ``ws3`` package, this user guide and the API all aim to help 
meet this goal.
