# ws3 - Wood Supply Simulation System

**ws3** (Wood Supply Simulation System) is a Python package for modeling landscape-level wood supply planning problems.

## Installation

We recommend installing `ws3` package into a Python venv (virtual environment) to minimize interactions with system-level packages. 

In [**000_venv_python_kernel_setup.ipynb**](https://github.com/ghasemiegh/ws3/blob/dev/examples/000_venv_python_kernel_setup.ipynb) we provide the instructions for how to set up a new venv-sandboxed Python kernel and make it available in your JupyterLab environment, assuming that you are running this notebook in a standard linux-based environment and a regular (non-root) using running commands in a bash terminal. 

## Modules 

`ws3` consists of the following main modules:

- **common.py**: Contains definitions for global attributes, functions, and classes that might be used anywhere in the package.
- **core.py**: Contains `Interpolator` class used by ``Curve`` class to interpolate between real data points.
- **forest.py**: Implements functions for building and running wood supply simulation models.
- **opt.py**: Implements functions for formulating and solving optimization problems. 
- **spatial.py**: Implements the `ForestRaster` class, which can be used to allocate an aspatial disturbance schedule (for example, an optimal solution to a wood supply problem generated by an instance of the `forest.ForestModel` class) to a rasterized representation of the forest inventory.

## Usage 

Multiple examples are available to demonstrate the utilization of ws3. Below is an overview explaining each of these examples:

- [**010_ws3_model_example-fromscratch.ipynb**](https://github.com/ghasemiegh/ws3/blob/dev/examples/010_ws3_model_example-fromscratch.ipynb): This example builds a new `ws3` model from scratch.
- [**020_ws3_model_example-woodstock.ipynb**](https://github.com/ghasemiegh/ws3/blob/dev/examples/020_ws3_model_example-woodstock.ipynb): This example builds a `ws3` model from Woodstock-format text input files.
- [**030_ws3_libcbm_sequential-fromscratch.ipynb**](https://github.com/ghasemiegh/ws3/blob/dev/examples/030_ws3_libcbm_sequential-fromscratch.ipynb): This example creates the linkages between `ws3` and `libcbm` from scratch (i.e., all code required to create these linkages is developed directly in this notebook).
- [**031_ws3_libcbm_sequential-builtin.ipynb**](https://github.com/ghasemiegh/ws3/blob/dev/examples/031_ws3_libcbm_sequential-builtin.ipynb): This example replicates what **030_ws3_libcbm_sequential-fromscratch.ipynb** does, but using `ws3` built-in `CBM` linkage functions.
- [**040_ws3_libcbm_neilsonhack-fromscratch.ipynb**](https://github.com/ghasemiegh/ws3/blob/dev/examples/040_ws3_libcbm_neilsonhack-fromscratch.ipynb): This example shows how to implement the Neilson hack (i.e., generate carbon yield curves from a CBM for use in a forest estate model) using `ws3` and `libcbm`.
